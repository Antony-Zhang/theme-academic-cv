    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of computational neuroscience through active learning in groups.
      The curriculum spans most areas of computational neuroscience, including Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, Stochastic Processes, and how to model. To finish the course, I worked with partners on the project *[The Working Memory Capacity of RNN]({{< relref "project/working-memory-capacity-of-rnn/" >}})*.

  #   summary: |
  #     I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

  #     Learned:
  #     - Synthesize your own blockchain solutions
  #     - Gain an in-depth understanding of the specific mechanics of Bitcoin
  #     - Understand Bitcoin’s real-life applications and learn how to attack and destroy Bitcoin, Ethereum, smart contracts and Dapps, and alternatives to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm
  # - title: 'Object-Oriented Programming in R'
  #   url: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/object-oriented-programming-with-s3-and-r6-in-r
  #   certificate_url: https://www.datacamp.com
  #   date: '2023-01-21'
  #   awarder: datacamp
  #   icon: datacamp
  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! My name is Zhidong Zhang (**张志东** in Chinese). I am a final-year undergraduate student in Software Engineering at Wuhan University, and am currently applying for graduate programs in computational neuroscience to start my journey in the academy. 

I am fascinated by the complexity of human brain cognition (e.g. working memory, decision-making, learning, and emotion), and I look forward to working at the intersection of neuroscience and computer science to advance our understanding of biological and artificial intelligence.
